# GIU-Interactive-Tour

### Project Guide:

1. We will work on the same node project
2. We will work using one database (but different Collections of course)
3. We will use node.js, express & mongoose
4. But don't change or add code or files in files or folders you did not create or worked on
   (Conflicts in merging)
5. Copy the latest main branch and always work on your `own` branch
6. Add `.gitignore` file and add this .gitignore file and any other IDE configuration file to
   it (we want only source code)
7. Any secret keys or variables to be added in the `Config.env` File
8. Maximum 80 characters on one line (Configure your IDE to add a line at `80` characters)
9. Work in a modularised way
10. Ask if unclear about something
11. Don't write deprecated code (there's always a better way)
12. Write lots of comments
13. Make sure you can access the github repo
14. Make sure you can access the mongoDB dashboard and add your ip-address
15. If you want to add some extra functionality or want to remind yourself go to the `github 
    repo > Projects tab > GIU Interactive Tour` and add it
16. Run `npm i` first to locally install all dependencies in package.js
17. to run server run `node server.js`
